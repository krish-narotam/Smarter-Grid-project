# Smarter-Grid-project
Science Fair 2020-21: developing a cost effective transition plan for a clean and 100% renewable grid.

The project started with the purpose of providing the economics of transfering our current grid structure into a fully renewable grid structure. 

Goals for the output of the code;
- Cost per household
- Cost per commercial extablishment
- Does the grid function
- the required number of renewables to begin the transition
