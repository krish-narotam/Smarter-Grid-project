# Smarter-Grid-project
Science Fair 2020-21: developing a cost effective transition plan for a clean and 100% renewable grid.

All of the simulation code is written in Java 15. 

The project started with the purpose of providing the economics of transfering our current grid structure into a fully renewable grid structure. 

Goals for the output of the code;
- Cost per household
- Does the grid function
- the required number of renewables to begin the transition

There was a great emphasis on ensuring that the different energy sources could be tailored to specific envornments. By doing this, if we want to run the code for another city, all we have to do is swap the data files and our API and code will do the rest. 

All of the code is in word files to ensure the easy access to many readers and easy updates with eclipse.
